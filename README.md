The goal of the project was to modernize the website of a store with low online figures.
I was a junior business analyst on the project.
As a result, the ordering process was optimized, navigation and user interface were improved and new requirements were developed to increase the usability of the web-site.
Tools: BPMN, UML, Draw.io, Miro, Figma.
